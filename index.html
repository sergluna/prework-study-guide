        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When applying a CSS rule, "*" means the rule will be applied to all the elements visble on the page</li>
          <li> div {color: blue; text-align: justify;}</li>

              <li>div is the selector which defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
              <li>Declarations contain two important components proprety:value, the CSS property we want to apply and the value of 
                  the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.
              </li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the card class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>A link element creates a connection to an external file</li>
          <li>The rel attribute, which goes inside of the link brackets, specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute, also goes inside of link brackets, specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path.
              This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html). To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.
